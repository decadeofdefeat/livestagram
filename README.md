livestagram
===========

Instagram real-time feed built on CodeIgniter.

I wanted to quickly build an application in PHP that can display a live feed of Instagram photos based on a specific hashtag. I set up an Instagram Subscription to a hashtag, and when Instagram hits my callback page, I search for new photos with the tag and enter them in my database. On the frontend page I'm using AJAX long polling of my server to check for new data.

This application allows for an adminstrator to "ban" photos using a simple admin panel. The admin panel receives a live feed from Instagram with virtually no delay, and the frontend page has a 2 minute delay.

This project was built as a subdirectory to a website, so it would be yoursite.com/livestagram. Obviously this can be changed to be a root directory. 


Update 12.04.2013  
-------------------------  

I realized I forgot a few things when I first committed, namely the htaccess file for redirecting the index.php page. I also fixed some issues with the main Subscribe model that wasn't loading properly.

** If you can't get the .htaccess file to work, then just append index.php to the URL, like http://yoursite.com/livestagram/index.php/install/
